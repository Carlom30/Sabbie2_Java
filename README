this is a game i wanted to do since my first uni year, this game will follow the idea that the first sabbie, project from 
"programmazione 1" that professor Santini gave us as part of his really interesting and well made exam.

this is the first time i must declare that the code here is not open source and so none is uthorized to use it but Professor GRILLI
for his exam, this is why this progect is made at the end of the day.

the fist idea was to make this game in C language and openGL, but i found more interesting to make this game
for an exam too, and since i wont have another exam like the the last mentioned, i decide to make Sabbie 2
in Java language as part of "programmazione di interfaccie grafiche" exam.

this game is for PC only and wont have a apple version.
